# Coding Style Guide & Stub Code

## Coding Style Guide

#### **Requirements:**

1. Comments
   1. Functions must be explained
2. Don't Repeat Yourself \(DRY\)
   1. Extract replicated algorithms/code into a new function
3. Indent/Brace Style
4. Files
5. Names:

```
my_function_name
```

#### Recommendations:

1. Comments
   1. Use a standardized documentation box for functions
2. Don't Repeat Yourself \(DRY\)
   1. Divide a big problem into several smaller problems
   2. Small solutions can become repeatable functions
3. General Formatting
4. Indent/Brace Style
5. Variables

## Stub Code

This objective focuses on external functions.

```c
 void my_function(void);
 
 int main(void)
 {
     [....]
 }
 
 void my_function(void)
 {
     printf("Yatta! \n");    // Short form of Japanese that means "(I/We) did it!"
     return;
 }
```
