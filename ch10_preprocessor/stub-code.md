for the sake of time and space code will be presented in stub form, thus it is not guaranteed to shown in complete form.

an example of stub code is shown below:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define PRINT_CHAR(letter) putchar(letter)
int main(void)
{

    char someLetter = 42;
    PRINT_CHAR(someLetter);



[...code...]

}
```

A preprocessing directive is any processor command, beginning with a hash symbol \(\#\), that provides a particular function
