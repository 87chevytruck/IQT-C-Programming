# Statements and Blocks

a statement is an expression followed by a semicolon
    
    ```c
    ``[expression];//example`
    
    `i = 0;  // assignment expression``
    
    ```

a block consists of a group of statements that are made into a single statement

-blocks may also contain declarations

    ```c
    `{...};   //block example`
    
    `{`
    
    `int i = 0;//declaration statement part of a block`
    
    `i++;  //single statement part of a block`
    
    `i *= 2;   //single statement part of a block`
    
    `if (i >4)//single statement part of a block`
    
    `{ ... }//a nested block of statements within a block`
    
    `}`
    
    ```
